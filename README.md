# Image Processing Techniques

This repository contains ready to run code for the following image processing techniques:

* Image Gradient
* Image Smoothness
* Image Histogram (Intensity Histogram)
* Structural Similarity Index of Two Images

## How To Run
The code is in ready to run condition. Just install the imported modules in Python 3.6 and run the code.

## Examples
Below are some images processed using the code given in this repo.

### 1) Image Gradient
An image gradient is a directional change in the intensity or color in an image. Here Laplacian Gradient Filter is applied to calculate the gradient.

### 2) Image Smoothness
Smoothing is often used to reduce noise within an image.

### 3) Image Histogram (Intensity Histogram)
In an image processing context, the histogram of an image normally refers to a histogram of the pixel intensity values. This histogram is a graph showing the number of pixels in an image at each different intensity value found in that image.

### 4) Structural Similarity Index Measure of Two Images
SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images.
